# all_the_small_things
# Small experimental snippets I came across and created along the way...

## Pyxpressive app
A protoapp written during my testing of NLTK tools for NLP <br>
It allows user to perform basic lexicostatistical analysis of given texts. <br>
Also, the list of referential words was obtained with blood and tears as I used <b> regular expressions </b> to extract these from a webpage sourcecode



## Pfylter apps
A basic prototype of a simple photo editor to compare the use of PyQt5 and tkinter libraries

## reciPy app
A basic GUI that generates a random recipe
Tech. stack:<br>
* <b>sqlite3</b> --> database of recipes connected to the program<br>
+ tkinter, pillow, pyglet, numpy libraries

## maPyka app
Primary codes for a custom GUI APP that generates mathematical assignments for kids <br>
In the future, I will: <br>
* update GUI
* make a functionality that generates assignments into html (and CSS) template (with use of jinja)
* template will be transformed into pdf
* GUI will allow user to choose types of assignments and then generates a chosen number of these
 --> each student will thus recieve his own assignment with specific random values
